### Performance Considerations
- Tool functions use Firebase batch operations where possible
- Retry logic includes exponential backoff to prevent API hammering
- Error storage is limited to prevent memory leaks
- Voice operations are optimized for low latency

### Security Features
- All tool functions validate organization ownership
- Member access is properly scoped to organization context
- Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage
- Retry limits prevent abuse

## ðŸ“Š Usage Examples

### Quick AI Actions
```javascript
// Direct integration in any component
import { sendMessage } from "$lib/stores/chat";

// Get organizational insights
await sendMessage("Analyze our current structure", { 
  useAgent: true, 
  orgId: organizationId 
});

// Voice-enabled interaction
import { startListening, speakText } from "$lib/stores/voice";
const transcript = await startListening();
await speakText("Task completed successfully");
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
import { retryWithBackoff, parseErrorType } from "$lib/stores/aiErrors";

// Automatic retry with backoff
const result = await retryWithBackoff(
  () => apiCall(),
  'api',
  'Calling external service'
);
```

The AI integration is now significantly more powerful, reliable, and user-friendly, providing a comprehensive assistant for organizational chart management with voice capabilities, smart analysis, and robust error handling.
