### 3. Add Member (Priority: P1)

**User Story:** _As an org admin, I want to add a person (name, picture, role, e-mail) and optionally set their manager so the chart stays current._

**Acceptance Criteria:**

#### Add member

- **Given** I'm on `/org/{id}/members/new`

- **Then** the member appears in the database and in the org chart under the chosen manager

#### Validation
